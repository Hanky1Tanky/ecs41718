    <h1>Life:</h1>
    <h4>Age 0-4</h4>
    <p>I lived in a pretty bad neighborhood growing up at the ages 0-4 and to be honest i dont remember much except i visted mexico here and there</p>
    <h4>Age 5-8</h4>
    <p>At this point in my life i found what i loved in life and that was basketball,and i also moved into indiana.I also became a gamer,and even though i wasnt the best at this age i still was better then most people</p>
    <h4>Age 9-12</h4>
    <p>By th age of 9 i had moved back to chicago, into my old neighborhood from when i was younger.By this point i was a decent basketball player ,nothing to crazy.I became wayyy better at games,and i went to a new school which i would stay until 8th grade year.I would also meet people who i would talk to today</p>
    <h4>Age 13-Present</h4> 
    <p>By the time i was 13,i created a reputation for myself as a "dribble god"atleast in my neighborhood,i also graduated and went to Lane tech which is one of the best schools in chicago, but it takes about 1hr and 30 minutes to get to school and back.At the moment it is two days till my b-day so yeahhh. </p>
